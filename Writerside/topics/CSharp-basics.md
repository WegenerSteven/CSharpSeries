# ðŸ’» C# and .NET Mentorship Track â€“ CSK Web Development Program

Welcome to the **C# and .NET Mentorship Track** under the Computer Society of Kirinyaga (CSK) Web Development Program.  
This documentation serves as your **official learning guide** â€” combining theoretical explanations, practical exercises, and curated resources to help you master modern software engineering using the **Microsoft .NET ecosystem**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By the end of this mentorship track, you will:

- Understand the **fundamentals of C# programming** and .NET architecture.
- Learn to build **real-world web applications** using **ASP.NET Core**.
- Apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to design maintainable systems.
- Use **Git and GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
- Deploy and manage .NET applications in **cloud environments** (Azure, Docker, etc.).
- Gain confidence to build **production-ready backend systems** and contribute to open-source projects.

## ðŸ§  What You Will Learn

The program is divided into structured modules:

| Module | Topics Covered | Skills Acquired |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **1. Git & GitHub** | Version control, branching, merging, collaboration workflows | Team collaboration and source control mastery |
| **2. C# Basics** | Syntax, data types, control flow, functions | Core programming logic in C# |
| **3. OOP in C#** | Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction | Object-oriented software design |
| **4. .NET Framework & CLI** | Project structure, build pipeline, NuGet | Understanding .NET internals |
| **5. ASP.NET Core** | MVC pattern, APIs, routing, middleware | Full-stack web backend development |
| **6. Entity Framework Core** | ORM, migrations, relationships | Database integration with .NET |
| **7. Deployment** | Docker, Azure, CI/CD | App hosting and continuous delivery |

Each topic is supported by **guides**, **practical labs**, and **demo projects**.
