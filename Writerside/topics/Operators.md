# C# Operators
Operators in C# are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. For example, consider the expression
`2 + 3 = 5`, here `2` and `3` are **Operands**, and `+` and `=` are called **Operators**. Operators in C# are used to manipulate
the variables and values in a program.
```C#
int x = 10, y = 20;
int result1 = x + y; //Operator Manipulating Variables, where x and y are variables and + is operator
int result2 = 10 + 20; //Operator Manipulating Values, where 10 and 20 are value and + is operator
```
>In the above example, x, y, 10, and 20 are called Operands. So, the operand may be variables or values.

## Types of Operators in C#
The Operators are classified based on the type of operations they perform on operands in C# language. They are as follows:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Unary Operators or
7. Ternary Operator or Conditional Operator
